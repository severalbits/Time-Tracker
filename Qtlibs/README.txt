TimeTracker is developed in Qt and therefore must provide you with a way to recompile and execute the original application since LGPL license is used.

TimeTracker is dynamically linked. Object files (the application) that are necessary for this process as well as all libraries are accessible in the following directories :

- Qt 5.10 libraries are in the directory "Qtlibs"
- Application object is in the directory "app"
