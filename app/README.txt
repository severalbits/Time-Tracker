TimeTracker is developed in Qt and therefore must provide you with a way to recompile and execute the original application since LGPL license is used.

TimeTracker is dynamically linked and therefore provides you all the libraries and object files (the application) that are necessary for this process.

- Qt 5.10 libraries are in the directory "Qtlibs"
- Application object is in the directory "app"
